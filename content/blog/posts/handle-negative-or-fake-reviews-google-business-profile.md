Maintaining a positive online reputation is vital—**buyers heavily trust online reviews**. When a negative or fake review lands on your profile, it can damage trust and even impact visibility in search. The key is to **respond quickly, calmly, and professionally**, using a consistent process. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

> _Note:_ “Google My Business” is now called **Google Business Profile**. The steps below still apply.

## Step 1 — Assess the review
Read carefully and gather context. What happened, when, and where? Check internal notes, tickets, or emails so you understand the situation before replying. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Step 2 — Confirm it’s a real customer
Smaller teams often know their clients by name. If you can’t match the reviewer to a record, treat it cautiously—it may be **mistaken or fake**. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Step 3 — Respond within 24 hours
Your reply is public and reflects your brand. Stay professional, empathetic, and solution-oriented. Acknowledge the issue, share a brief next step, and provide a **direct contact** to continue the conversation offline. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

**Example reply:**
> Hi [Name] — We’re sorry to hear about this. We take your experience seriously and want to help. Please email us at support@searchandbefound.com or call 828-399-0447 so we can look into the details and make this right.

## Step 4 — Resolve the issue offline
Listen, diagnose, and propose a fair resolution. Document what you offered so your public reply can reference that the team followed up and handled it. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## Step 5 — Close the loop
After resolution, kindly let the customer know they’re welcome to **update their review** if they feel the matter was handled. Many will. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## Prevention beats cure
Exceptional service and a clear internal process reduce the odds of negative reviews in the first place—and help you act decisively when they do appear. Consistent, professional handling can **turn a bad moment into proof of your integrity**. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
