faq:
  title: "Magento FAQs"
  items:
    - q: "How long does an M1 → M2 migration take?"
      a: "Scope drives timeline—data volume, theme complexity, and integrations. We phase must-haves first, then roll out nice-to-haves to de-risk launch."
    - q: "Do I need custom modules?"
      a: "Not always. We prefer native features or stable extensions. We only write modules when it clearly improves revenue, UX, or maintainability."
    - q: "Will I lose my SEO?"
      a: "No. We map URLs, keep metadata, fix canonicals, and launch with redirects, sitemaps, and structured data to protect and often improve rankings."
    - q: "Can you make Magento fast?"
      a: "Yes. Clean theme, cache discipline, CDN, and minimal JS are the levers. We tune Redis, FPC, and media strategy to your actual traffic."
    - q: "What about license costs?"
      a: "Magento Open Source (Community Edition) has no license fee. Adobe Commerce adds enterprise features; we’ll recommend it only when ROI is clear."
